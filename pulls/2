# Whatâ€™s included:
- Added ARCHITECTURE.md, PRD.md, SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md, MODBUS-API.md.
- Added compatibility notes with Heater Control Modbus Master (dobord/h-id_heater_control_modbus_master_stm32f401ccu6).
- Documented masked updates via FC=16 and Short/Long IO flows.
- Detailed DeviceMemoryModbus layout (offsets, short/long exchange, sensor status/values, dev_ctl).
- Clarified USB-CDC usage for logging and service via [h-id_heater_gui](https://github.com/dobord/h-id_heater_gui).

# Key points:
- CTRL_FLAGS mirrors coil flags and supports atomic masked updates.
- SHORT_IO_BASE is published in Holding; short_response has a fixed offset = 16.
- Operations are idempotent to tolerate master retries.

# Next steps (optional):
- Sync concrete OPCODE values for short/long operations with the master implementation.
- Pin exact DeviceControlRegister_SensorTemperature field layout in dev_ctl.
